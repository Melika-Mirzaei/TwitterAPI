## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Twitter Developer Account (to obtain API keys and access tokens)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace the placeholders in the `API3.java` file with your actual Twitter API credentials.
3. Compile the program using the JDK:
   ```
   javac API3.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
